  <strong><p> Subject - Notice of lease expiration and renewal </p></strong>

  <p>Dear {{tenantName}},</p>

  <p>
    This letter is being sent to inform you that your current lease at 
    <strong>{{propertyAddress}}</strong> is, as you may be aware, set to expire on 
    <strong>{{leaseEndDate}}</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>Please review the following renewal options, as stipulated in your existing lease agreement:</p>

  <p>
  We have greatly appreciated having you as a tenant, and we would like to extend the opportunity
for you to continue your tenancy at our property. In accordance with the terms of your current
lease agreement, we are providing you with this notice 60 days in advance to discuss the renewal
options.
</p>

  <p>
    <strong>• SEMI ANNUAL LEASE RENEWAL:</strong><br />
    If you choose to switch to a semi-annual lease, please be advised that the monthly rent will increase by 
    {{newSemiAnnualRent}}. This option provides flexibility but comes with a higher monthly cost.
  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
    • ONE YEAR LEASE RENEWAL:<br />
    Opting for a one-year lease renewal will result in the following change:
    {{oneYearRentChange}}. This fixed-term option offers stability and predictability for the upcoming year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please carefully consider the above-mentioned terms and inform us of your decision by 
    <strong>{{responseDeadline}}</strong>. You can contact us at <strong>{{ownerPhone}}</strong> or via email at 
    <strong>{{ownerEmail}}</strong> for any further queries.
  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
    Please be advised that all other terms of your original rental agreement remain in effect.<br />
    We value your tenancy and look forward to continuing our positive landlord-tenant relationship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regards,<br />
    <strong>{{ownerName}}</strong><br />
    <strong>{{propertyAddress}}</strong><br />
